Overview
Safe parcel is a project meant to provide safe carriage of parcels  from sender to recipient. The goal is to minimise users moving from station to station sending and receiving parcels, but instead, users can send their parcels while sitted at home  in their comfort zone and the package  will be delivered  to the recipient’s doorsteps. 
Goals
Creating a safe carriage of parcels from sender to recipient.
Creating a well recorded statement while transporting our customers' goods.
Reducing the hustle for our clients to move around as they look for best ways to send their parcels.
Creating jobs for young, ambitious kenyans. 
Specifications
This project  has six phases that will ensure safe transport of items. The app works in transfer method of operation for instance:-
Client makes a receipt document as soon as it's done the recipient is notified immediately that there’s a package coming their way and from who. From this point the package can be traced.
When the sender has delivered to the relevant station, the receipt is transferred from the client's record to the driver’s account. 
Upon delivery to the station, the recipient is notified again that the package is ready for pickup. If in Nairobi, he/she will assign a boda boda to pick the item from the bus station to his/her house providing location coordinates.


PHASE ONE
Clients must have installed our app on their android phone. He/she makes a receipt which is a starting point of the parcels journey and documentation. Details to be imputed are:-
Name of package.
Serial number of item(If t has no serial no eg Farm produce then the system gen a serial no for the parcel)
Image of item
Destination and recipient details(name and location)
Vehicle number (this might be the No. plate of the boda boda or the vehicle assigned to carry the package)
Drivers details (responsible person)
